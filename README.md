### **5. Development Phases**

#### **a. Setup**  
- **Environment Setup:**  
  - Initialize a GitHub repository and set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.  
  - Create Docker containers for the development environment, including Go, SQLite, and Vite.  
  - Install required libraries and dependencies:  
    - **Frontend:** AppRun, Vite, ESLint, Prettier.  
    - **Backend:** Gin, Go's `crypto` package, OAuth2, Kong API Gateway.  

- **Project Structure:**

  /project-root
  ├── /frontend (AppRun app with Vite for bundling)
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── app.js
  │   └── styles.css
  ├── /backend (Golang server)
  │   ├── main.go
  │   ├── /api
  │   └── /models
  ├── /db (SQLite database file and migrations)
  │   └── game.db
  ├── /docker
  │   └── Dockerfile
  └── /docs (Markdown documentation)
  
#### **b. Prototyping**  
- **Prototype Tasks:**  
  - Set up basic API endpoints in Gin for player stats, inventory, and actions.  
  - Build a simple frontend interface to interact with the backend (e.g., menus for combat, crafting, and fishing).  
  - Use SQLite to store mock data for player progression and items.  
  - Ensure communication between frontend and backend is functional using dummy data.  

#### **c. Core Development**  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Expand the backend to handle core mechanics: combat calculations, skill progression, and item crafting.  
  - Add visual elements to the frontend for UI enhancements (e.g., progress bars, item icons).  
  - Implement the game loop:  
    - Backend handles actions (e.g., fighting mobs, completing quests).  
    - Frontend updates dynamically based on backend responses.  
  - Integrate OAuth2 for user authentication.  

#### **d. Content Creation**  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Add data to the SQLite database for dungeons, mobs, items, and quests.  
  - Develop additional UI components for trading, crafting, and slayer tasks.  
  - Write and integrate milestone quests and narrative dialogues.  
  - Create templates for capes and other high-tier equipment progression.  

#### **e. Final Polish**  
- **Optimization:**  
  - Compress assets and optimize frontend performance using Vite.  
  - Fine-tune database queries and server response times.  
- **Sound and Music:**  
  - Add ambient soundtracks and sound effects for actions like fishing, combat, and crafting.  
- **Bug Fixes:**  
  - Perform thorough testing for edge cases and fix all identified issues.  

#### **f. Packaging**  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Use Docker to containerize the application for deployment.  
  - Ensure compatibility with self-hosted infrastructure.  
  - Provide an easy setup guide in the Markdown documentation for installation and running.  
  - Export a final build of the frontend using Vite, ready to be served via the backend.  

---### **6. Documentation**

- **Code Comments and Explanation:**  
  - Include inline comments throughout the code to explain key logic, especially for:  
    - Core mechanics (e.g., combat, crafting, skill progression).  
    - API endpoints in the backend (e.g., what each route does and what data it returns).  
    - Database schema and queries for clarity on how data is stored and accessed.  
  - Add JSDoc-style comments for frontend functions and GoDoc comments for backend functions and types.  

- **Game Guide:**  
  - Provide a Markdown file (`/docs/game_guide.md`) with the following sections:  
    - **Overview:** Explain the game concept, genre, and mechanics.  
    - **Getting Started:** Describe how to create a new character and start playing.  
    - **Gameplay:** Detail the actions players can perform (e.g., combat, crafting, fishing).  
    - **Progression:** Outline how to level up, unlock new quests, and earn milestone capes.  
    - **Tips and Tricks:** Provide strategies for maximizing efficiency in different skills.  

- **Setup Instructions:**  
  - Include a clear `README.md` file in the root of the project with the following:  
    - **Prerequisites:**  
      - Docker and Docker Compose installed.  
      - Git installed to clone the repository.  
    - **Setup Steps:**  
      1. Clone the repository:
bash
         git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
         cd your-repo-name
         
2. Build and run the Docker containers:
bash
         docker-compose up --build
         
3. Access the game: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.  

    - **Environment Variables:** Provide examples for configuring API keys, database paths, or OAuth2 settings in a `.env` file:

      DATABASE_PATH=./db/game.db
      OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
      OAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
      
- **API Documentation:**  
  - Use Swagger or a simple Markdown file (`/docs/api_reference.md`) to list all available API endpoints, their parameters, and response formats.  
  - Example:

    POST /api/combat/attack
    Request Body:
    {
        "playerId": "12345",
        "enemyId": "67890",
        "attackType": "melee"
    }

    Response:
    {
        "success": true,
        "damageDealt": 25,
        "playerHealth": 75,
        "enemyHealth": 50
    }
    
- **Troubleshooting Guide:**  
  - Add a section to the `README.md` for common errors and their solutions (e.g., “Database connection error” or “API Gateway not responding”).
